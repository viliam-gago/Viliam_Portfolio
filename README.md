# My Portfolio

This portfolio contains a few examples of my personal projects. Please feel free to take a look on results of work I published in [other repositories](https://github.com/viliam-gago?tab=repositories), in case of further interest.

## [Project 1: JustEatCycles Data Analysis](https://github.com/viliam-gago/JustEatCycles_Analysis)
In this project, I analyzed the real world dataset of Just Eat Cycles company, providing bicycle rentals in Edinburgh. Data contains information about particular trips, their duration, bicycle stations, etc. 

Technologies used: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, gmaps library

**Project workflow in keypoints:**
- **Database accessing, joining tables from different resources**
- **Data wrangling**
- **Visualisation**
- **Basic use of linear regression**
- **Interaction with geographical data**

## [Project 2: Automated File Downloader](https://github.com/viliam-gago/automated_file_downloader)
I created automated solution for multiple file extraction from particular server. This was a personal project I came up with at my workplace on my own initiative. In the end, even my colleagues started using the script and we were able to significantly reduce amount of time spent by tideous downloading files one by one.

Technologies used: Python, BeautifulSoup, libraries used for threading and multiprocessing

**Features:**
- **Downloading all files located in given project's folder from the server**
- **Use of threading to speed up the downloading process**
- **Simple GUI - no need to write any code for use**
- **Runs from .exe file for easy & quick access**

## [Project 3: Stock Analyzer](https://github.com/viliam-gago/stock_analyzer)
The process of stock evaluation uses basic methods of value investing, which I tried to implement in Python algorithm. Use of Pandas library was very convenient in this case. In the end app offers quick calculation of many stock metrices, like debt ratios, intrinsic value, cashflow growth etc., requiring just the ticker symbol of particular stock. This project gave me new insights of Python modules, especially Pandas and served as a great learning experience.

**Main keypoints:**
- **Created script to get historical data from quick.fs.net API**
- **Utilized data to convenient format using Pandas DataFrames**
- **Implemented an algorithm to calculate stock fundamentals**
- **Used of visualization tools when suitable**

## [Project 4: Moving-Least-Squares Algorithm](https://github.com/viliam-gago/moving_least_squares)
I took this project as a voluntary work at my university during summer holiday. We dealt with problem of fitting a 3D surface on datapoints measured during experiment. Main goal was to implement slightly more advanced version of commonly used Ordinary-Least-Squares algorithm (OLS) - Moving-Least-Squares (MLS). The main idea is to calculate the approximation of each point based just on the measured datapoints in it's "close neighborhood". 

Although I didn't get the algorithm working sufficiently for larger datasets for three-dimensional dataset, the 2D solution works fine. Better performance could be achieved by use of proper vectorization of the code.

This project was great exercise for getting hands dirty with NumPy library and thorough refreshing of linear algebra.

## [Project 5: Pomodoro Timer](https://github.com/viliam-gago/pomodoro_timer)
App was created in order to explore working with PyQt5 library. It also stores results in csv format to track your study discipline. Personaly - in the end, it proved itself to be quite useful tool - I used it quite a while to keep myself accountable during earlier days of my learning journey.

**Features:**
- **Created user interface for easy usage with PyQt5 library**
- **Implemented adjustable countdown timer**
- **Elapsed time saved into external file to track your study hours - you can plot how many hours you spent studying each day !**
