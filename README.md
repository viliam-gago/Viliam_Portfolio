## Project 1: Stock Analyzer
The process of stock evaluation uses basic methods of value investing, which I tried to implement in Python algorithm. Use of Pandas library was very convenient in this case. In the end app offers quick calculation of many stock metrices, like debt ratios, intrinsic value, cashflow growth etc., requiring just the ticker symbol of particular stock. This project gave me new insights of Python modules, especially Pandas and served as a great learning experience.

- Created script to get historical data from quick.fs.net API
- Utilized data to convenient format using Pandas DataFrames
- Implemented an algorithm to calculate stock fundamentals
